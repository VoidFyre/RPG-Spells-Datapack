1. Create folders: earlyspells, frostwitch, and glaciallord
2. Inside earlyspells, create folders: level1, level2, and level3
3. Inside frostwitch and glaciallord, create folders: level4, level5, and level6
(All of this mimics the same structure as the fire and necromancy files)
4. Inside each level, create 2 spells, and in each spell, create a "loop" folder and a "trigger" folder
